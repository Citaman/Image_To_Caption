# Image to caption with Flickr 30k dataset

This project was made entirely with [GoogleColab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

This was my first attemp to a Image to caption model using VGG16 pretrain model from keras for the image processing part. 
And a LSTM layer for Seq model.

With a custom callback i managed to watch the autoregressive part of the model to see the progress of the model
